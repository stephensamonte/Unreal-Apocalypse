## Gameplay

We are looking to recreate the game [Inside by Playdead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPcolQbesz4), with our own unique twist. We want to capture the creepy and mysterious feel of the game, while adding new gameplay puzzles of our own.

## Story

An Artificial Intelligence has taken over the world. Your goal is to turn off the machine and save your friends from being slaves forever. (obviously we need some work/details here, but you get the gist)
